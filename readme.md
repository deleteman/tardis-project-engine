# Project Tardis - Back-end module

Welcome to Project Tardis, this is my humble attempt at taking you back in time (hence the name, get it?) to an era where Text Adventures where the greatest form of digital entretainment... with a twist. 

This project attempts to provide a back-end service able to server as a game server, capable of supporting a variaty of text adventures that can be played, both, in single and multi-player mode.
